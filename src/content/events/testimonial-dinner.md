What an incredible way to start Rorys Testimonial Year, with a full house in The Ashes Suite at The Kia Oval!
Rory and his beautiful wife Victoria were surrounded by Rory's Surrey teammates, Surrey CCC Chairman and CEO, Oli Slipper and Steve Elworthy, Richard Gould ECB CEO and many friends and family.

Mark Church was in charge of making sure we raised lots of money through the auctions and a game of Heads & Tails. He also hosted a brilliant and funny fireside chat with Rory, Jason Roy, Matt Dunn and Gareth Batty.

We danced the night away, DJ Emma Conybeare and sax player Julia Harrison providing the
tunes!
