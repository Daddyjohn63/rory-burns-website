This fantastic black-tie event takes place on June 19th at Cutlers’ Hall in the City of London, starting at 6.30pm with carriages at 11.30pm. The initial champagne reception with canapes will be followed by a three-course, Indian-themed feast with wine.

Join Rory Burns, friends and colleagues, including Kumar Sangrakkara, Tom Curran and Sam Curran, Sam Billings and Jason Roy for what promises to be a unique evening. The dinner is on the eve of the Headingley First Test match and Rory and Kumar will be discussing the enticing prospect of the five-test England/India series.

During the dinner there will be a live auction to help raise money for Rory's Testimonial and his chosen charities.
