On the eve of the first day of the England v India test series, we enjoyed an intimate “Taste of India Gala Dinner” at the magnificent Cutler’s Hall in London.

Mark Church expertly hosted a panel of cricket legends which comprised Jason Roy, one of England’s all time great white ball cricketers; Kumar Sangakkara, one of the highest run scorers in test cricket; and England internationals Sam Billings and Rory Burns.

They shared their fascinating experiences of playing international cricket against India, the unique pressure of playing in the IPL and the key things to look out for in the upcoming test series.

This was followed by a raffle and a live auction of money can’t buy lots including a batting masterclass with England’s Jamie Smith and a round of golf with Rory Burns and Jason Roy at the exclusive Queenwood Golf Club.
