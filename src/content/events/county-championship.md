The Surrey vs Yorkshire fixture at The Oval May 16th-19th was dedicated to Rory and proved to
be one of the best events so far in this important Testimonial Year.

Record attendance figures and a very well-supported raffle were boosted by the excellent
weather and Surrey’s performance on the field, which led to an innings victory early on Day
Four.

The winners of the raffle will be contacted on May 20th. Thanks to all who took part and
support Rory’s two charities this Testimonial Year - the Surrey Cricket Foundation and the
GLF Schools’ Foundation.

It was also an opportunity for supporters to buy Rory-themed merch in The Surrey Shop.
The special baseball caps, hoodies, bucket hats and pink cricket balls will be on sale in the
Shop for the rest of the season, as well as at other Testimonial events.
