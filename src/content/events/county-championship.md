Join us at The Kia Oval from May 16th to 19th for a special four-day County Championship match against Yorkshire, dedicated to Rory Burns as part of his 2024 Testimonial year. This match is not only a chance to enjoy top-class cricket, but also an opportunity to celebrate one of Surrey’s all-time greats and support two incredible causes, the Surrey Cricket Foundation and the GLF Schools’ Foundation.

Play begins each day at 11am, and tickets are available through The Oval ticket office, just like any other County Championship match. Throughout the game, the Testimonial Committee will be fundraising for Rory and his charities. You’ll see volunteers in Rory Burns T-shirts around the ground selling raffle tickets for just £5 each. Prizes include:

- A batting masterclass with Ollie Pope
- Test match tickets
- Signed England ODI and Test shirts
- Joe Root’s signed batting gloves

Raffle winners will be drawn on Monday, May 20th, so don’t miss your chance, find a seller near The Surrey Shop or catch one around the ground carrying a charity bucket. While you're there, check out the exclusive Rory Burns Testimonial merchandise available at The Surrey Shop on the main concourse. Items include baseball caps, hoodies, bucket hats, golf tees, and even pink cricket balls, all designed in collaboration with Rory himself.

So come down, enjoy some fantastic cricket, and show your support for Rory Burns and his testimonial year!
