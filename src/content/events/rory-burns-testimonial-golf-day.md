We welcomed 20 groups to the Rory Burns Testimonial golf day at the beautiful Longcross course at Foxhills. We were blessed with great weather, fabulous food and super company, which all made for a brilliant day.

Rory was joined by Surrey staff and team members including Alec Stewart, Jason Roy, Dom Sibley, Dan Lawrence, Ben Foakes, Dan Worrall, Tom Lawes and Ollie Sykes, all of whom hosted a group.

The golf day was won by Surrey and England’s Ben Foakes, together with Robert Plowman, Jack Tyson and Ben Schaafsma.

Exciting auction items included an Oval Invincibles helmet signed by Sam and Tom Curran, and Testimonial bats signed by this summer’s England Test squad.

A huge thanks to Foxhills for hosting us so well, and to our guests for making it a truly memorable day.
