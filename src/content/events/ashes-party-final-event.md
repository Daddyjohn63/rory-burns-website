The final event of Rory’s testimonial year took place at the Oval. It was fun filled evening of dinner, dancing and celebrating. Jeffrey Archer ran a live auction with exciting lots including golf with Alec Stewart and Jamie Smith’s maiden Test 100 bat.

Steve Elworthy, the Surrey CEO, unveiled a magnificent portrait of Rory which will be hung in the Micky Stewart Pavillion’s Long Room. The evening then continued at the Beehive pub where guests watched the Ashes Test Match from Adelaide.

Rory commented:

“It has been a huge honour to have been granted a testimonial by Surrey. I would like to thank the club and Members for their support, not just this year, but throughout my entire career.
A special thanks to my testimonial committee who have worked tirelessly to organise a wonderful series of events. I have really enjoyed celebrating with friends, family, teammates and supporters.
I look forward to seeing you all at the Oval in 2026 when we will be trying to win back the County Championship.”
