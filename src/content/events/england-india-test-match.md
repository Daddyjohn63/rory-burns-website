On Saturday 3 August, Day 3 of the England v India Test Match at the Oval, there will be a number of activities connected to Rory’s testimonial including being able to participate in a silent auction for unique, money can’t buy cricketing experiences.

We will also be selling Rory’s testimonial merchandise signed by Rory and his teammates and raising money for his designated charities.
