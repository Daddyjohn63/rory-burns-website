The final England v India Test Match at the Kia Oval was an epic game and an emotional one, as the cricket world came together to celebrate the life of Surrey and England legend Graham Thorpe.

We ran a silent auction for Roryâ€™s testimonial on Day 3. The lucky winners can look forward to a bowling masterclass with Gus Atkinson, who took 5 for 33 in the first innings of the match; a batting masterclass with replacement England captain Ollie Pope; and a fabulous cruise, kindly donated by Ambassador Cruises.
