On 20 August 2025 Banstead CC is hosting a coaching day for juniors and a special T20 match as part of the Rory Burns Testimonial year. Rory started his career at Banstead, so this is a special day for him and the club.

The day starts at 12 midday with a coaching session for the U11s, followed by an U12 and above coaching session at 1pm, and a simultaneous U11 softball competition at 1pm.

The Marquee Bar opens at 12.30pm, followed by an informal fundraising curry lunch from 1.30pm, fun games, an auction, and a Q&A with Rory at 2.30pm. Starting at 4.30pm there will be a Banstead Allstars v Surrey Allstars T20 match, commentated by Mark Church.

Tickets for the coaching sessions – currently only available to Banstead CC juniors - cost £25. That includes a coaching session attended by a Surrey CCC player, an autographed bat, a place in the guard of honour and a food truck voucher. Testimonial year merchandise will be on sale throughout the day.

The address of the venue is Banstead CC, Avenue Road, Banstead SM7 2PP. Tickets for the fundraising lunch are on sale from April 21 for Banstead CC members, and from May 5 for the wider Surrey cricket community. They cost £65/head through Ticket Tailor.

There are also premium tables costing £100 per guest (10 places per table) that give the opportunity to be joined by a Surrey CCC player. Players already confirmed are Dom Sibley, Ryan Patel and Matt Spreigel.
