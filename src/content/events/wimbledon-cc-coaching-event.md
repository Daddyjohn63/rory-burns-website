On May 2 Wimbledon CC, an iconic ground in the shadow of Wimbledon’s world-famous All England Tennis Club, hosted a fantastic coaching event for juniors as part of the Rory Burns Testimonial Year.

Wimbledon has one of the largest juniors sections in the country, ranking 5th nationally for participation by women and girls, and this special Friday night club night attracted 100 juniors, boys and girls.

Five Surrey CCC players, including Rory, Jason Roy and Cameron Steel, coached batting, bowling and keeping , while parents and friends enjoyed a BBQ. The threatened rain held off throughout, and the event raised a fantastic £4K for the Testimonial charities. After the coaching, Wimbledon CC treated the Surrey players to an excellent curry provided by the club’s own chef.

It was great to see a new generation of Surrey CCC supporters in the making, and this event offers an excellent model that other clubs in the county might want to copy during the Testimonial Year. For further details please contact the Testimonial committee.
