            Rory Burns&apos; testimonial year is more than a celebration of his
            remarkable cricketing careerâ€”it&apos;s an opportunity to make a
            lasting impact. Throughout the year, Rory will be supporting two
            incredible charities:{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">GLF Schools&apos; Foundation</span> and
            the <span className="font-bold">Surrey Cricket Foundation</span>.
            These organisations reflect Rory&apos;s passion for education and
            community development.
