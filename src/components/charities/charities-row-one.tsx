            Rory Burns&apos; testimonial year is more than a celebration of his
            remarkable cricketing careerâ€”it&apos;s an opportunity to make a
            lasting impact. Throughout the year, Rory will be supporting two
            incredible charities: GLF Schools&apos; Foundation and the
            Professional Cricketers&apos; Association (PCA) Trust. These
            organisations reflect Rory&apos;s passion for education, community
            for education, community development, and the well-being of current
            and former cricketers.
